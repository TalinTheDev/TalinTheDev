A question that people ask me all the time. "Talin, who are you?" And to be honest, I don't really know. But with so
many instances of me being asked this question and not having a reply I could feel happy with, I have recently started
thinking about this question. Who am I? 

And this is what I have come up with. This is, who I am.

# A Programmer
I know one thing for sure, I am a programmer. I love coding and I've been doing it for what seems like forever. Coding
is one thing that I can confidently say I am passionate about. I know this for a fact. But yet at the same time, I know
for a fact that I don't want to become a software engineer. I don't want coding to be my job. I don't want to deal with
the pressures of the business world and have it ruin my passion for something that I truly enjoy doing.
